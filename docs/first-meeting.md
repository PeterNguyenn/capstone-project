### Purpose of the Meeting

The meeting focused on discussing the development of a mobile application for the MB Mentors program at Sheridan, aimed at assisting first-year students through mentoring and workshops.

### Key Points Discussed

#### 1\. Overview of the MB Mentors Program

*   **Objective**: To provide mentoring support to first-year students at Sheridan, enhancing their orientation experience and academic success.
    
*   **Target Audience**: Primarily first-year students, with mentors being second, third, or fourth-year students.
    
*   **Activities**: Workshops on study habits, time management, mental health, and participation in open house events.
    

#### 2\. Application Development

*   **Type of Application**: Taran envisions the project as a mobile app that students can install on their phones.
    
*   **Roles**:
    
    *   **Mentors**: Second to fourth-year students who will guide first-year students.
        
    *   **Program Manager**: Initially Taran, but could be a professor in the future, responsible for overseeing the program and managing mentor applications.
        

#### 3\. Features of the Application

*   **Mentor Application Process**: Students can apply to become mentors through the app, which will include an application workflow.
    
*   **Event Management**: The program manager can create and manage mentoring events, allowing mentors to sign up for participation.
    
*   **Tracking Volunteer Hours**: Mentors can log hours spent on events to earn co-curricular record credits.
    
*   **Training Resources**: The app may include training materials for mentors, such as videos and guidelines.
    

#### 4\. Technical Considerations

*   **Platform**: The app could be developed for iOS, Android, or as a web-based mobile application to maximize accessibility.
    
*   **Integration**: Initial development should minimize integration with existing Sheridan systems to simplify the process.
    

#### 5\. Sustainability and Future Development

*   **Past Program Challenges**: The previous iteration of the program was paused due to the original professor's time constraints. The goal is to create a sustainable model that can be easily managed by different individuals over time.
    
*   **Future Features**: Potential future capabilities could include one-on-one mentoring relationships and AI chatbots for student inquiries.
    

#### 6\. Administrative Functions

*   **Admin Capabilities**: Administrators will need to review and approve mentor applications, create events, and manage user accounts.
    
*   **User Interface Guidelines**: The team will explore existing Sheridan design standards to ensure consistency with other Sheridan technologies.
    

#### 7\. Communication and Collaboration

*   **Meeting Frequency**: Taran can dedicate 1-2 hours per week for meetings, with the team suggesting Fridays as a suitable time for discussions.
    
*   **Project Timeline**: The team needs to prepare a proposal for their professor by Tuesday next week, prompting the need for further meetings and collaboration.
    

#### 8\. Action Items

*   Taran will send additional information and user stories related to the application.
    
*   The team will prepare a proposal for their professor, incorporating the discussed features and objectives.
    
*   Future meetings will be scheduled to refine the project plan and address any outstanding questions.

*   Michael will perform the presentation next week.

*   Rashed will prepare the powerpoint slides for the presentation.

*   Raj will create trello task based on what Taran provide.
